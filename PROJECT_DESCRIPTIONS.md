## INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

**"Tell me about a project you're proud of":**

"I recently built a Cybersecurity Toolkit that demonstrates my understanding of security and encryption. The tool uses AES-256 encryption to secure files, implements multiple hashing algorithms for data integrity, and includes a password strength analyzer. What I'm most proud of is that it uses industry-standard cryptography libraries and follows security best practices - it's not just a demo, it's a functional tool that could actually be used to protect sensitive data."

**"What technologies are you familiar with?":**

"I'm proficient in Python and have hands-on experience with Flask for building REST APIs. I've implemented backend systems with features like contact form processing, visitor analytics, and project showcase endpoints. I'm also familiar with security concepts - I've worked with encryption algorithms like AES-256, cryptographic hashing using SHA-256 and MD5, and data validation. I understand REST API architecture, JSON data handling, and CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication."

**"What interests you about cybersecurity?":**

"I'm fascinated by how cryptography protects our digital lives. While building my security toolkit, I learned how encryption algorithms like AES-256 work, why hashing is irreversible, and how websites actually store passwords securely. I implemented these concepts from scratch, which gave me deep understanding of security principles. I'm particularly interested in how simple Python code can create powerful security tools that protect sensitive information."
